# Interview Practice App

A role-focused interview practice web app that showcases an interactive demo, a structured simulator, and a transparent case study of the build. The initial release targets web and product roles, with AI-assisted feedback added incrementally as usage and content grow.

## Project Scope

### MVP Features
* **Landing page** with an interactive Q&A demo to introduce the brand, highlight the core value proposition, and showcase the team.
​
* **Interview simulator** with curated question sets, model answers, and explanations for Web Developers, Python Developers, UX Designers, Product Owners, and Scrum Masters.

* **Project case study** that documents the design and development journey, including problem framing, MVP decisions, and lessons learned.
​

### Additional Planned Features
* **Authentication** so users can create profiles and save interview sessions and feedback history.

* **Social sharing** of achievements or session summaries to LinkedIn and Facebook.

* **Focus areas** within each role (for example: front-end, back-end, system design, stakeholder communication).
​
* **LLM-powered grading** for open-ended questions, including scores and targeted suggestions.
​
* **LLM-generated feedback summaries** across a full session to highlight strengths, gaps, and trends over time.
​
* **Role-specific resources** for further learning, such as curated articles, courses, and practice prompts.
​
* **Graphical or scenario-based questions** (for example: UI mockups, architecture diagrams, or user flows) to simulate more realistic interview challenges.
